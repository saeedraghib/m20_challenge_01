# *Smart Contract - (m20_challenge_01):*<br><br>

## **Description:**<br>
A fintech startup company has recently hired you. This company is disrupting the finance industry with its own cross-border, Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. Currently, the team is building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.
<br>
To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, you’ll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
<br>
<br>

### ***Task 1:***<br>
Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity.
<br>
### ***Task 2:***<br>
Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM.
<br>
### ***Task 3:***<br>
Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract.
